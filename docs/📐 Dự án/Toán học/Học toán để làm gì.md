Khái niệm:: 
> Also, as I said before, just because a subject happens to have some mundane practical use does not mean that we have to make that use the focus of our teaching and learning. It may be true that you have to be able to read in order to fill out forms at the DMV, but that’s not why we teach children to read. We teach them to read for the higher purpose of allowing them access to beautiful and meaningful ideas. Not only would it be cruel to teach reading in such a way— to force third graders to fill out purchase orders and tax forms— it wouldn’t work! We learn things because they interest us now, not because they might be useful later. But this is exactly what we are asking children to do with math.

> The analogy I make is: Imagine an art class in which they only teach you how to paint fences and walls, but never show you the paintings of the great masters. Then of course you will say, 'I hate art.' But in fact what you would really be saying is 'I hate painting the fence.' And so it is with mathematics, that we teach our students how to paint fences, and never show them the mathematics of the great masters.
